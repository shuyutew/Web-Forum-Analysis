# Web-Forum-Analysis
'''
The social and linguistic dynamics of an on-line community.
There is a theory in social science, that people adopt similar patterns of language use when they
interact. (See, for example, Gonzales et al.1) This assignment will investigate whether this concept
is evident for an online forum, where participants communicate with each other via conversations in
a thread. That is, you will investigate whether members who are communicating directly with each
other (via threads) use similar language, which may be different to other members of the forum.
You are also required to investigate whether the language used changes over time. For example,
does the proportion of language expressing optimism change?
Using the metadata and linguistic summary from a real on-line forum you are required to analyse
these questions using some or all of the data provided.
The data is contained in the file webforum.csv and consists of the metadata and linguistic analysis
of 20,000 posts over the years 2002 to 2011. The linguistic analysis was conducted using Linguistic
Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), which assesses the prevalence of certain thoughts, feelings and
motivations by determining the proportion of key words in language. See http://liwc.wpengine.com/
